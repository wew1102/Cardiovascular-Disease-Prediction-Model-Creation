Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Model Creation
 
Objective:
To create a predictive model for identifying the risk of cardiovascular disease using the provided dataset. This task will involve Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) followed by model development.
 
Dataset:
The dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmudulhaqueshawon/cardiovascular-disease
 
Columns:
id: Unique identifier for each individual
age: Age of the individual in years
gender: Gender of the individual (1 - female, 2 - male)
height: Height of the individual in cm
weight: Weight of the individual in kg
ap_hi: Systolic blood pressure
ap_lo: Diastolic blood pressure
cholesterol: Cholesterol level (1 - normal, 2 - above normal, 3 - well above normal)
gluc: Glucose level (1 - normal, 2 - above normal, 3 - well above normal)
smoke: Smoking status (0 - non-smoker, 1 - smoker)
alco: Alcohol intake status (0 - non-drinker, 1 - drinker)
active: Physical activity level (0 - inactive, 1 - active)
cardio: Target variable indicating the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease (0 - no disease, 1 - disease)
