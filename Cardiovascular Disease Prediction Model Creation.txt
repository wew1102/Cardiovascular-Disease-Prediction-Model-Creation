Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Model Creation

Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a person having cardiovascular disease based on various health-related features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle habits. This is done using the dataset provided on Kaggle.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle:  
[Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmudulhaqueshawon/cardiovascular-disease)

Columns:
- id: Unique identifier for each individual
- age: Age (in days, converted to years)
- gender: 1 - female, 2 - male
- height: Height in cm
- weight: Weight in kg
- ap_hi: Systolic blood pressure
- ap_lo: Diastolic blood pressure
- cholesterol: 1 - normal, 2 - above normal, 3 - well above normal
- gluc: 1 - normal, 2 - above normal, 3 - well above normal
- smoke: 0 - non-smoker, 1 - smoker
- alco: 0 - non-drinker, 1 - drinker
- active: 0 - inactive, 1 - active
- cardio: Target variable (0 - no disease, 1 - disease)

Steps Performed

1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data structure inspection and summary statistics
- Visualizations like count plots and correlation heatmaps

2.Feature Engineering
- Converted age from days to years
- Removed irrelevant columns (`id`)
- Removed outliers in blood pressure
- Scaled features for model training

3.Model Development
- Model used: `RandomForestClassifier`
- Trained on 80% of data and tested on 20%

4.Evaluation & Interpretation
- Classification report & confusion matrix
- ROC curve and AUC score (Achieved ~0.76)

Result
The model successfully predicts cardiovascular disease risk with an AUC score of **0.76**, indicating decent performance and the potential to improve with further tuning and feature optimization.
